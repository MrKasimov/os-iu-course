Lets compare 3 strategies of dealing with deadlock:

1) Detection and â€‹Recovery - requires keeping log of ownership, but generally 
is a good option as it does not cost much

2) Avoidance - the most difficult option. The reason is that a system has to 
anticipate the deadlock. All resource requests are done in a safe order, 
which is not time-efficient. Also it has to store information about all 
resources, which is not memory-efficient. But the adventage is that this method 
is dynamic 

3) Prevention - relatively simple option, just make 1 out of 4 conditions false.
The adventage is that no cost involved, but it can not be applied always. 
Sometimes changing conditions is not an option
